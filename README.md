**Walking Fingerprinting Using Wrist Accelerometry during Activities of Daily Living in NHANES**

 

**Abstract**: We propose a method for identifying individuals based on their wrist-worn accelerometry during activities of daily living. The method consists of three steps: (1) using Adaptive Empirical Pattern Transformation (ADEPT), a highly specific method to identify walking; (2) transforming the accelerometry time series into an image that corresponds to the joint distribution of the time series and its lags; and (3) using the resulting images to construct a person-specific walking fingerprint. The method is applied to 15,000 individuals from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) with up to 7 days of wrist accelerometry collected at 80 Hertz. The resulting data contains more than 10 terabytes, is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude larger than previous data used for activity recognition, is collected in the free living environment, and does not contain labels for walking periods. Using extensive cross-validation studies, we show that our method is highly predictive and can be successfully extended to a large, heterogeneous sample representative of the U.S. population: in the highest-performing model, the correct participant is in the top 1% of predictions 96% of the time.
